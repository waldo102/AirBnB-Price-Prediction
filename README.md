# AirBnB-Price-Prediction
Goal: Use AirBnB housing data to predict the daily accommodation rate for a client's house in Bondi Beach.

Data: insurance.csv
  * contains 20 variable and 27k observations

Files:
  * airbnb_price_prediction.ipynb - performs data cleaning, data preparation, data analysis, and also model specifications and hyperparameter tuning.
  
Models:
  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regression
  * Random Forest Regression
  * Support Vector Regression

Performance Metrics:
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  
Conclusions:

The Random Forest model edged out the other models in terms of accuracy. Typically, it is very difficult for models to perform well
with a limited amount of variables and observations. The models under consideration each performed well, but the Random Forest
was able to predict insurance premiums more precisely. For this task, the Random Forest regressor is the best model.

In addition, according to the data, the most important variables in determining AirBnB prices are the following:

 1. Number of Bedrooms
 2. Number of people that can be accomodated
 3. Number of Bathrooms
 
The data tells us that if a person is looking to charge their customers more for using their home, they would need to look into 
expanding the number of people the living complex can accomodate. This is reasonable because the more people a home can accomodate,
the more money an owner can charge for using their facility.
